/** \page ex_utility_alarm Utilities: Alarms

BSP430's infrastructure supporting alarms is documented at @ref
grp_timer_alarm.  The program below provides a command-line interface allow
interactive configuration of alarms.  It should work on MCUs with at least
1024 bytes of RAM (needed for the various buffers supporting the
command-line interface), including the @c exp430f5438 and @c exp430fr5739
platforms.

By default, the application uses ACLK as the alarm source.  SMCLK may be
selected by adding:
@code
AUX_CPPFLAGS=-DAPP_SMCLK_SRC=1
@endcode
to the compilation command.
