This example uses the SkyTraq Venus 638FLPx to synchronize the LFXT-driven
crystal timer with GPS time.  It leverages the Fragpool library
(http://pabigot.github.com/fragpool) to simplify package management; you
need to get a copy of that into this directory with:

git clone git@github.com:pabigot/fragpool.git

Build and install as usual.  You may need to add support for your specific
experimenter board.  Note that the console is set to 115200 so it's faster
than the GPS serial input for debugging.
